Recommended scope (small + solid)

Problem: Predict next-day (t+24h) PM2.5 at a single monitoring station within one city.

Features (all easy to get / engineer):

Recent pollution: PM2.5 lags (t-1h, t-6h, t-12h, t-24h), and rolling means (6h, 12h, 24h).

Weather (observed): temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction (also use sin/cos for wind dir), precipitation.

Calendar: hour of day, day of week, month, day-of-year as sin/cos pairs; holiday flag (optional).

(Optional but still small): co-pollutants PM10/NO₂ if they come in the same file — otherwise skip to stay minimal.

Why this scope?

It’s small (one station, ~30–80k hourly rows) yet captures the main drivers (meteorology + persistence).

Works with tabular tree models (lags & engineered features) and with a lightweight sequence NN (LSTM/1D-CNN on the last 48–72 hours).

Clear, measurable target (one step ahead), easy baselines, and no messy socioeconomics.

Modeling setup (apples-to-apples)

Target: PM2.5 at t+24h.
Train/Val/Test split: chronological (e.g., first 70% train → next 15% val → last 15% test).
Baseline: persistence (predict tomorrow equals today’s same hour), plus a simple linear regression.

Model A — Tree-based (compact & strong):

Algorithm: LightGBM or XGBoost.

Inputs: the engineered lags/rollings + weather + calendar.

Tune lightly: num_leaves, max_depth, min_child_samples, learning_rate, n_estimators.

Interpretability: feature importance + partial dependence (or SHAP if you want).

Model B — Neural network (still small):

Sequence window: last 48–72 hours of features → predict t+24h.

Architecture: 1D-CNN (fast) or small LSTM/GRU (1–2 layers, 32–64 units), dropout, early stopping.

Inputs shape: [batch, seq_len, n_features].

Standardize features; don’t leak future info when building windows.

Metrics: MAE and RMSE in µg/m³. Also report skill over persistence:
Skill (%) = 100 * (1 − MAE_model / MAE_persistence).

Data choice (keep it simple)

Pick one city with hourly PM2.5 + weather in the same file so you avoid merges:

Examples that are easy to work with: Beijing PM2.5 / multi-site AQ datasets, or any single-city station from OpenAQ/air agency exports where met vars are present.

If co-pollutants are missing, don’t chase them — the weather + lagged PM2.5 setup is enough for a clean project.

What we’re not doing (to stay small)

Not predicting next year: that needs long-term emissions & socioeconomic signals — different problem class.

Not using national or cross-city panels: adds heterogeneity and data wrangling overhead.

Not broad socioeconomic/industry features: they’re coarse, slow-moving, and help annual models more than daily forecasting.

Not heavy spatial models or graph nets (save as stretch goals).

Minimal checklist to implement

Load one station’s hourly data → drop rows with missing target/essential features.

Create lags/rollings (t-1,6,12,24; 6h/12h/24h means), calendar sin/cos, wind sin/cos.

Split chronologically → fit persistence & linear baselines.

Train LightGBM/XGB → tune lightly → record MAE/RMSE + importance.

Build windowed tensors (48–72h) → train small LSTM/1D-CNN with early stopping.

Compare to baseline; plot predicted vs actual on the test tail; report skill over persistence.
